# How to Play ðŸš€

### Download and Install:

1. Go to the [Releases](https://github.com/your-username/your-repo/releases) page.
2. Download the latest release for your platform.
3. Open your terminal and navigate to the folder where the executable is downloaded.
4. Copy the executable to the `/usr/local/bin` directory using the following command:

    ```bash
    sudo cp ./guessing_game /usr/local/bin/
    ```

Now you can run the game from any terminal window by simply typing its name `guessing_game`, thanks to its location in `/usr/local/bin`.
